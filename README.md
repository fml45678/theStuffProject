The stuff project is a place to catalog all of your stuff and build communities around stuff. You can buy, sell, trade, give away, or whatever verb you can think of that applies to your stuff. It is nice to know what you have, maybe you can't always see your stuff because it is tucked away somewhere, and this makes it easy to forget you even have it. Create an inventory of everything you have and easily search through to see it.
